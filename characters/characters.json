Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and a Spartan General, up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them, albeit by accident, under Ares' command, earning him the nickname of the 'Ghost of Sparta', after which he renounced his service to the War God, eventually killing him and ascending to Godhood by becoming the new 'God of War', before exacting revenge against his father, the Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him. After successfully exacting his vengeance, Kratos escaped into the world of Norse Gods by settling down in Midgard in Ancient Norway where he married another woman named Faye and bore a son named Atreus who together, after the boy's mother’s death, would embark on a journey to spread her ashes at the highest peak of all the nine realms.",

Will that allow me to bring my love back from the grasp of Hades himself!? If not, then at least I can bathe in the glory of being the one who brought down the mighty Kratos. The Slayer of Gods. Although I hardly think a harpy's fool such as yourself deserves such praise."
